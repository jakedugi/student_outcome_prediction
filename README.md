Train and evaluate a state-of-the-art model for predicting student outcomes using clean, modular ML pipelines.

---

## Highlights

- **One-command pipeline** – `python main.py train` runs the full pipeline: data loading, preprocessing, training, and evaluation.
- **Modular architecture** – Swap models, scalers, or input features using clean abstractions (`Preprocessor`, `BaseClassifier`, `TrainingPipeline`).
- **Terminal-first design** – Full evaluation reports and model leaderboard printed in terminal. No notebooks required.
- **Easy model registry** – Add/remove models in a single line in `src/models/registry.py`.
- **Production-ready layout** – Separation of concerns for config, training logic, and model orchestration.

## Quick-start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jakedugi/student_outcome_prediction.git
cd student_outcome_prediction
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dataset Setup

You have two options to get the dataset:

#### Option 1: Using Kaggle API (Recommended)

1. Install the Kaggle package:
```bash
pip install kaggle
```

2. Set up your Kaggle credentials:
   - Go to [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com) → Account → Create API Token
   - Download `kaggle.json`
   - Place it in `~/.kaggle/` and set permissions:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.kaggle
mv kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/
chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
```

3. Download the dataset:
```bash
kaggle datasets download -d thedevastator/higher-education-predictors-of-student-retention
unzip higher-education-predictors-of-student-retention.zip -d data/
rm higher-education-predictors-of-student-retention.zip
```

#### Option 2: Manual Download

1. Go to [Dataset Page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/higher-education-predictors-of-student-retention)
2. Click "Download"
3. Extract the ZIP file
4. Place `dataset.csv` in the `data/` directory

### Running the Model

Once the dataset is in place, run:
```bash
python main.py train            # Full 2-semester baseline
python main.py train --semesters 1
python main.py train --semesters 0
```
